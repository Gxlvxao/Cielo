    "home.faq.q7": "Do you help with mortgage and financing solutions?",
    "home.faq.a7": "Yes. We collaborate with trusted mortgage lenders and financial institutions to introduce financing options suited to your profile, whether you are a resident or non-resident buyer.",
    
    "home.faq.q8": "How do you assess the Feng Shui of a home?",
