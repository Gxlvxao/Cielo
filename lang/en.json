    "home.faq.q2": "Do you only sell homes?",
    "home.faq.a2": "No. At CIELO, we go far beyond transactions. We support our clients with market analysis, property curation, relocation guidance, credit solutions, Feng Shui assessments, and independent inspections.",
    "home.faq.q3": "Where are you based?",
    "home.faq.a3": "Our studio is based in Lisbon, with a strong presence in Cascais. While these are our core markets, we have extensive experience selling and advising on homes throughout Portugal. We operate under license AMI 12818.",
    "home.faq.q4": "How do I start working with CIELO?",
    "home.faq.a4": "It all starts with a conversation. We dedicate time to understanding your goals, lifestyle, and priorities before presenting opportunities that truly fit.",

    "home.faq.a5": "We work with both. In all cases, our approach is guided by transparency, ethics, and clear alignment of expectations from the start.",
    "home.faq.q6": "Do you work with other agents and professionals?",

    "home.faq.q7": "Do you help with credit and financing solutions?",
    "home.faq.a7": "Yes. We collaborate with trusted credit intermediaries and financial institutions to present financing options tailored to your profile, whether you are a resident or non-resident.",
    "home.faq.q8": "How do you assess the Feng Shui of a home?",
    "home.faq.a8": "Our Feng Shui analysis considers orientation, natural light, circulation, and layout. When necessary, we collaborate with certified consultants to evaluate energy flow and harmony.",
    "home.faq.q9": "Can you help after the purchase is complete?",
    "home.faq.a9": "Yes. Our relationship doesn't end at the deed. We continue to support clients with post-purchase needs, including renovations, interior design, and utility management.",
    "home.faq.q10": "Is the service suitable for investors?",
    "home.faq.a10": "Yes. While many clients seek us for their own homes, we also advise investors looking for quality assets, long-term value, and strategic positioning in the Portuguese market.",
